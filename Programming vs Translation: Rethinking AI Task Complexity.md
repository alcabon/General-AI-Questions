(Claude Sonnet 4) : 

Your question touches on a really fascinating point about the nature of language model learning.

## How AIs Learn to Program

Models like me learned programming in the same fundamental way as everything else: by analyzing enormous amounts of text during training. This included millions of lines of source code, technical documentation, discussions on forums like Stack Overflow, tutorials, etc.

Programming presents certain advantages for machine learning:
- **Deterministic logic**: Code follows strict and consistent rules
- **Immediate feedback**: A program either works or doesn't
- **Repetitive patterns**: Many structures and idioms are repeated
- **Rich documentation**: Tons of commented and explained examples online

## Translation vs Programming

You're absolutely right to question this hierarchy! Translation is indeed extraordinarily complex:

**Complexities of translation:**
- Cultural and contextual nuances
- Wordplay, idioms, implicit references
- Language registers (casual, formal, technical...)
- Multiple semantic ambiguities
- Subtle emotional connotations

**Why programming might seem "more impressive":**
- Results are more tangible (an app that works)
- It's perceived as more "technical" socially
- Errors are more visible and binary
- Human expertise in programming is rarer than bilingualism

In reality, translating cultural nuances or humor with finesse requires as sophisticated an understanding of the world as designing complex software architecture. 
Both are remarkable feats for an AI!

## Approximate difficulty evaluation (out of 10)

**Important:** These scores are very approximate and vary enormously depending on context!

### "Structured" tasks
- **Simple code/scripts**: 3-4/10
- **Complex software architecture**: 7-8/10
- **Formal mathematics**: 5-6/10
- **Data analysis**: 4-5/10

### "Linguistic/cultural" tasks
- **Literal translation**: 4-5/10
- **Literary/poetic translation**: 8-9/10
- **Humor and wordplay**: 8-9/10
- **Deep cultural nuances**: 9/10

### "Creative/conceptual" tasks
- **Technical writing**: 5-6/10
- **Original artistic creativity**: 9-10/10
- **Philosophical reasoning**: 7-8/10
- **Fine emotional understanding**: 8-9/10

### Factors that influence difficulty:
- **Ambiguity** (+2-3 points)
- **Required cultural context** (+1-2 points)
- **Original creativity** (+2-3 points)
- **Immediate feedback available** (-1-2 points)
